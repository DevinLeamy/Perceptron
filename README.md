# Perceptron
A perceptron tied with a visualization of its thinking. <br/>
This perceptron is capable of estimating the value of linear function (f(x) = mx + b) <br/> 
with up to 100% accuracy. The visualization, built using java.swing, allows you to watch <br>
as it learns to make better estimates adjusting its weights and biases along the way.
